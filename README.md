A custom library for multiphysics simulation with FDM

MultiPhysics Finite Difference Method Library for Electromagnetic-Thermal-Fluid Problems
Introduction
This library is a high-performance computational tool designed for solving multi-physics coupling problems in electromagnetics, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics. Built on the finite difference method (FDM), it provides a unified framework to simulate complex interactions governed by Maxwell's equations, heat conduction equations, and Navier-Stokes equations. The library is ideal for applications in electronic device cooling, renewable energy systems, aerospace engineering, and more.
